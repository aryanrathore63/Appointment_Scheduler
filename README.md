# Dr. Appointment Scheduling App

The Dr. Appointment Scheduling App is a web application designed to streamline the process of scheduling appointments for doctors. The app leverages various technologies including Python Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a comprehensive solution for managing appointments.

## Features

- **Google API Integration**: The app integrates with the Google API to seamlessly create events in the doctor's calendar. This allows for efficient synchronization and ensures that appointments are accurately reflected in the doctor's schedule.

- **Python Django**: The app is built using the Django framework, which provides a robust foundation for developing web applications. Django's features, such as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and routing system, enhance development efficiency and maintainability.

- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript**: The app utilizes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to create an engaging and user-friendly interface. The combination of these technologies enables the design of responsive and visually appealing web pages.

- **SQLite Database**: The app employs an SQLite database to store and manage appointment data. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine that offers simplicity and portability, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications.

- **Django Pre-built Features**: The app takes advantage of Django's pre-built features, such as user authentication, form handling, and template rendering. These features reduce development time and effort, allowing for rapid implementation of core functionalities.
